        A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
        The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle
        exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions,
        and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform
        all of these functions by repeated processes of addition. Most
        calculators these days require electricity to operate. Portable,
        battery-powered calculators are popular with engineers and engineering
        students. Before 1970, a more primitive form of calculator, the slide
        rule , was commonly used. It consisted of a slat of wood, called the
        slide, that could be moved in and out of a reinforced pair of slats.
        Both the slide and the outer pair of slats had calibrated numerical
        scales. A movable, transparent sleeve called the cursor was used to
        align numerals on the scales. The slide rule did not require any source
        of power, but its precision was limited, and it was necessary to climb a
        learning curve to become proficient with it.
